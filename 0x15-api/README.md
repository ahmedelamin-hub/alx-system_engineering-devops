Description
This repository contains an assignment focused on APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), which allow different software applications to communicate with each other. The goal is to understand how APIs work, how to design and consume APIs, and how to integrate them into applications. APIs are essential for enabling communication between different systems, such as web applications, services, and databases.

Learning Objectives
Understand the basics of API architecture, including RESTful APIs and web services.

Learn how to design and document APIs, following best practices such as OpenAPI (Swagger).

Understand HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and status codes in API communication.

Learn how to authenticate and authorize API requests using methods like API keys, OAuth, and JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

Explore the process of consuming third-party APIs and integrating them into your applications.

Understand error handling, rate limiting, and versioning in API design.

Learn about tools like Postman and Swagger UI for testing and documenting APIs.

Implement and consume APIs using popular programming languages and frameworks (e.g., Python Flask, Node.js Express, Java Spring).
