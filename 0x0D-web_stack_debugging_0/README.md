Description
This repository contains an assignment focused on Webstack Debugging, the process of identifying and resolving issues within a web application stack. The goal is to develop skills for troubleshooting and diagnosing problems in web servers, application servers, databases, and network configurations. Effective debugging is crucial for ensuring the stability and performance of web applications.

Learning Objectives
Understand the architecture of a typical web stack, including the web server, application server, database, and client-side components.

Learn common tools and techniques for debugging web applications (e.g., browser developer tools, logs, and network tools).

Troubleshoot issues related to server configurations, performance bottlenecks, and application errors.

Debug database queries, optimize SQL performance, and resolve issues with data consistency.

Use monitoring tools to identify and resolve issues in real-time (e.g., New Relic, Datadog, Prometheus).

Understand how to handle errors, including HTTP errors (404, 500), server timeouts, and security vulnerabilities.
