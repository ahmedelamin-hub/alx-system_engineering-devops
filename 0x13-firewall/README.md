Description
This repository contains an assignment focused on Firewalls, which are critical components of network security. The goal is to understand how firewalls function, how to configure them, and how to use them to protect systems and networks from unauthorized access. Firewalls play a key role in network security by filtering incoming and outgoing traffic based on security rules.

Learning Objectives
Understand the role of firewalls in network security and their function in controlling traffic flow.

Learn about different types of firewalls (hardware, software, network, and host-based).

Configure firewall rules to allow or block traffic based on IP addresses, ports, and protocols.

Explore stateful vs. stateless firewalls and their differences.

Implement firewall strategies for securing servers, applications, and internal networks.

Understand how to configure and manage popular firewall tools (e.g., iptables, ufw, firewalld).

Learn about advanced firewall concepts like intrusion detection, logging, and DMZ configurations.
