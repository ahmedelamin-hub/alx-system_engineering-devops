This repository contains an assignment focused on mastering loops, conditions, and parsing in programming. The goal is to develop a strong understanding of these fundamental concepts by implementing various tasks that require iteration, decision-making, and data extraction.


Learning Objectives

Understand and implement different types of loops (for, while, etc.).

Use conditional statements (if, else, elif) effectively.

Parse and manipulate data from different sources such as text files, command-line input, or APIs.

Improve problem-solving skills through structured programming.


Requirements

A programming language that supports loops and conditions (e.g., Python, Bash, JavaScript, etc.).

Basic understanding of syntax and logical structures.

A code editor (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text) and a terminal/command promp
